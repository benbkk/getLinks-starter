# An Experiment of Bootstrap Implementation with React (That I hate the least)
Definitely **not** a recommendation or an example how to implement Bootstrap in your react project.

## Progress & todos
- [x] The dreaded Bootstrap Navbar markups!
- [x] Carousel
- [x] Grid Example

## Featuring
- Webpack 4
- Emotion JS 
- Bootstrap 4 Native **No JQuery**
- Bootstrap 4 CSS from CDN **unfortunately**

## Conclusions
- Don't use bootstrap, for whatever it is you want to do with react.
- There are really other, better much more suitable solutions. 
- Probably most of the development time will be spent on matching 

## Getting Started

```
git clone && cd
yarn
```

### Development
```
yarn dev
```

### Production
```
yarn build
```
